# FTLAV
*FTL: Faster Than Light Adventure Visualiser*

This (currently highly experimental and totally not user-ready!) application is a tool that generates a nice visualisation of your current game of FTL: Faster Than Light (www.ftlgame.com) while you play.

Large chunks of the code used in this Java-based application come from [Vhati](https://github.com/Vhati)'s version of the [ftl-profile-editor](https://github.com/Vhati/ftl-profile-editor).

### TODO
- Adding actual graphs and visuals. If you can recommend a good Java library for this kind of stuff, please file an issue or make a pull-request.
- A cool looking and effective user interfaces inspired on the one you see in FTL.
- Removing all classes and methods taken from ftl-profile-editor that aren't needed for this project.
